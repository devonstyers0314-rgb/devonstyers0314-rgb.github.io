        I have a few goals for this course, I would like to learn more about computer science
        and using html, as well as get a good understanding of the project management side of things. Althought I am a finance professional,
        I have always had a personal interest in computers, and especially languages. I actually started when I was 12 or 13 by learning HTML and CSS
    </p>
<p>
    Some of my career goals have been met, most recently securing a real career spot in a professional investment comany.
    In the future, I want to focus on working my way up within my current company, and hopefully securing a director spot within the next 5 years or so.
    I would also like to hit $100,000 in total bonuses over the next 2 years, to obtain a personal goal of mine to pay off my house.
